# Si-N-Si
 A repository for any and all code for our CNC router project.

The way we've discussed this project so far, there may be at least 2 chunks of code that end up here:
	1. The code that takes in G-code, and turns it in to motor movements
	2. The code that acts as an HMI to create G-code and control the machine
Other possibilities include:
	3. Something to monitor the progress of the machine, such as a webcam that is streamed to a website.
